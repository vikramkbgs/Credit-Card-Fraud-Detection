# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. Fraud detection in credit card transactions is crucial to prevent financial losses for both cardholders and financial institutions. The project involves analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions, building and training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with a vast majority of transactions being non-fraudulent. It consists of anonymized features derived from PCA transformation due to privacy concerns. The dataset contains the following columns:

- Time: Time elapsed between transactions
- V1-V28: Principal components obtained by PCA
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)

## Installation

To run the code in this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:


## Model Building and Evaluation

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, scaling features, etc.
2. Model selection: Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, etc.
3. Model training: Training the selected model on the training dataset.
4. Model evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5. Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
6. Final model selection: Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
